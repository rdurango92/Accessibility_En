# Case Study Project - Wheelchair Ramps👩‍🦽

This was a case study proposed on the **Datacamp** platform, and in this notebook I present my findings.

## Problem Statement and context 📝.

> "🎊 <b>Congratulations</b> 🎉, you have landed your first job as a data scientist at National Accessibility"

 National Accessibility currently installs wheelchair ramps for office buildings and schools.
However, the marketing manager wants the company to start installing ramps for event venues as well. According to a new survey, approximately 40% of event venues are not wheelchair accessible. However, it is not easy to know whether a venue already has a ramp installed.

The marketing manager would like to know whether you can develop a model to **predict whether an event venue has a wheelchair ramp**. To help you with this, he has provided you with a dataset of London venues. This data includes whether the venue has a ramp.

It is a waste of time to contact venues that already have a ramp installed, and it also looks bad for the company. Therefore, it is especially important to exclude locations that already have a ramp. 

> **About Model Performance** 🎯 <br>
>Ideally, at least two-thirds of venues predicted to be without a ramp should not have a ramp.
